# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I have watched around 25% of the lecture videos.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I watch the videos at 10.00 AM on Mondays after the online lecture (before Practical session) in my room for approximately 30 minutes.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I check my code carefully to make sure naming conventions are correct, and I submit my practicals on time.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to watch lecture videos more consistently and stop skipping parts while reading the practical task, I should read everything carefully before starting the code.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I sometimes get stuck too long trying to understand parts discussed in the practical session and miss discussions on the next topic. Also, I often like to skim through the instructions only while doing the weekly practical tasks, I will read instructions more carefully before coding in the future to avoid skipping important details.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I listen actively in the practical sessions, complete the exercises in class, and check my code thoroughly before submitting.
